# Cheats

Documents the moments where I've checked other sources to see how something is done instead of black-boxing it.

## Vanilla Java Edition (MCP)
* (The decompiled upstream source code)
* To confirm if what wiki.vg stated about the status check was correct (that the client sends ping immediately after request, then closes)

## Hematite-Server
* (The mostly-dead Rust implementation from Piston)
* To see how they implement packet specifications for the protocol with macros
