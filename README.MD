A Minecraft Java Edition server written in Rust.

## Goals
- Use this to actually learn to program Rust "in the large", instead of "in the small" things like Advent of Code
- Explore alternative implementation strategies for things versus vanilla, such as perhaps using Bedrock Edition's ECS definitions for entities.

## Acknowledgements
- [wiki.vg](https://wiki.vg/Protocol) for mostly black-box documentation of the Java Edition protocol
- [burger](https://pokechu22.github.io/Burger/) for automated data extraction from the client jar

## License
I am an experienced Java Edition modder who has significant exposure to the decompiled and reverse-engineered Java Edition codebase.
As such, I don't think it would be accurate to say that anything I produce is "clean-room" and free from the influence of Java Edition's design decisions.
This project exists in the same legal gray area as Minecraft mods do.
As such, while the copyright of the code belongs to me, there is no defined license. (You probably don't want to be using this anyways..)
